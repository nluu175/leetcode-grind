# Sliding Window
`https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/window-sliding-technique/`
- This technique shows how a nested for loop in some problems can be converted to a single for loop to reduce the time complexity.
- The technique can be best understood with the window pane in bus. Consider a window of length n and the pane which is fixed in it of length k. Consider, the pane is initially at extreme left. Now, co-relate the window with array `arr[]` of size `n` and pane with `current_sum` of size `k` elements. Now, if we apply force on the window such that it moves a unite distance ahead, the pane will cover next `k` consecutive elements. This pane will cover next `k` consecutive elements.


## List of questions
### 1. Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K 
- Given an array of integers and a number k, find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.
- Easy. Simple sliding window problem.

### 
- Given an array of integers and a number x, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value.
