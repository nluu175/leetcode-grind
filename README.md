# Leetcode Grind

Why am I doing this to myself?


## Why Am I doing this?
- I need to prepare for my coding interview questions! For now, I am following this guide I got from redidt `https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sgktuv/the_definitive_way_on_how_to_leetcode_properly/`. 
- You can find a list of all Grokking the Coding Interview Patterns for Coding Questions at `https://github.com/cl2333/Grokking-the-Coding-Interview-Patterns-for-Coding-Questions`.
- I am going to restart from the beginning to refresh my mind and also thoroughly go over each topic again.
- After that, the plan is gonna be going through leetcode top 100.

## Goal:
- I expect to finsh this in less than 2 months
- Goal: To be able to solve hard problems in a about 20 minutes.
